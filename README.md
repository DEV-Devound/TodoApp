# Todo List Project

## Introduction
The Todo List project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js, MongoDB, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks by allowing users to add, delete, and edit items on their to-do list.

## Key Features
- **CRUD Functionality**: Users can perform basic CRUD operations on their to-do list, including creating new tasks, reading existing tasks, updating task details, and deleting tasks.
- **Node.js Backend**: The project utilizes Node.js for server-side scripting, enabling efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.
- **MongoDB Database**: MongoDB is used as the backend database to store and manage task data. It provides flexibility and scalability for storing tasks.
- **Simple User Interface**: The project offers a straightforward user interface for managing tasks, making it easy for users to interact with their to-do list.

## How it Works
1. **Add Task**: Users can add a new task to their to-do list by entering the task details and submitting the form. The task is then stored in the MongoDB database.
   
2. **View Tasks**: Users can view their existing tasks displayed on the screen. Tasks are fetched from the MongoDB database and rendered on the user interface.
   
3. **Edit Task**: Users have the option to edit the details of a task by clicking on the edit button next to the task. They can modify the task details and save the changes, which are then updated in the database.
   
4. **Delete Task**: Users can delete a task from their to-do list by clicking on the delete button next to the task. The task is removed from the database, and the UI is updated accordingly.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js used to build the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL document database for storing task data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js used to interact with the MongoDB database.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for creating the user interface and handling client-side interactions.

## Usage
1. **Add Task**: Enter the task details in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
   
2. **View Tasks**: Tasks will be displayed on the screen along with options to edit or delete them.
   
3. **Edit Task**: Click the edit button next to a task, make the desired changes, and click the "Save Changes" button.
   
4. **Delete Task**: Click the delete button next to a task to remove it from the to-do list.
